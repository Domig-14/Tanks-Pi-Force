# Tanks-Pi-Force
IMPORTANT: Please use the version of simpleGE that I have put in this repository. I found a minor bug that was messing with the game so I fixed it :)

Project Goals: Create a decently fun game where the player will battle waves of tanks for as long as they can before dying

INSTRUCTIONS: Use WASD to move and steer your tank, and use your mouse to fire

Overall I used simpleGE, piskel for my art, beepbox for my music, and I used freesound.org for the "boom" sound effect

Process:
I learned how to entirely create the art, programming, and sounds needed to fully develop and create a game.
I got stuck on enemy tank movement, bullet firing, enemy duplication, and even sound. Pretty much everything that could have gone wrong
did go wrong. Even through the project had a lot of setbacks, most of them were fixed by the time I first uploaded this (some minor bugs were not able to be fixed, due to time constraints)
I would like to improve the speed at which this project was developed, and my general skill level as a coder
Next time, I think I wont procrastinate as much.
I strayed a decent ways from the design doc, as some things (like covers, and random enemy movement) were FAAAAAR out of my skill level
How did I stay on track???? I didnt. I got distracted very easily, so this took a lot longer than it had to
